/**
 * Keeps the free 500 MB database from ever filling up (`npm run db:prune`, daily in news-digest).
 * Measured Oct 2026: +1.25 MB a day, 55 % of it unpublished rows kept only so the scraper does
 * not fetch the same pages again, and nothing was ever deleted. At 500 MB Supabase turns the
 * database read-only and the whole pipeline stops, so the job tightens itself as the database grows:
 *
 *   size       article bodies cut after   unpublished rows deleted after   old minor stories
 *   < 350 MB   RETENTION_DAYS (180)       90 days                          kept
 *   ≥ 350 MB   ≤ 90 days                  30 days                          kept
 *   ≥ 420 MB   ≤ 45 days                  30 days                          deleted (see below)
 *
 * A deleted row leaves its URL and SHA-256 in `seen_urls`, so the scraper still skips it.
 * "Old minor stories" (the owner's choice, Oct 2026) = published more than 2 years ago, in no
 * cluster, importance below 40 (already noindex), not a legal act, not edited, not in any digest.
 * Important stories, legal acts, clustered stories and digests are never deleted.
 * Every step works in batches of `BATCH` rows, so no statement runs into the query timeout.
